; void sprintLF(String message)
; String printing with line feed function
sprintLF:
    call    sprint
 
    push    eax         ; push eax onto the stack to preserve it while we use the eax register in this function
    mov     eax, 0Ah    ; move 0Ah into eax - 0Ah is the ascii character for a linefeed
    push    eax         ; push the linefeed onto the stack so we can get the address
    mov     eax, esp    ; move the address of the current stack pointer into eax for sprint
    call    sprint      ; call our sprint function
    pop     eax         ; remove our linefeed character from the stack
    pop     eax         ; restore the original value of eax before our function was called
    ret                 ; return to our program
